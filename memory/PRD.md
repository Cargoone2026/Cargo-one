# Cargo One — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Import the existing Cargo One application from the `Cargoone2026/Cargo-one`
GitHub repository into an Emergent workspace and continue development as a
production-ready full-stack web app. The repository is the single source of
truth (FastAPI backend + MongoDB + Stripe + Google Maps + marketing website +
customer, driver and admin portals). Because the original frontend is an
Expo/React Native app, the frontend has to be **ported to standard React web
(CRA)** without altering the backend business logic, API contracts, catalog
data, deposit math or visual language.

## Constraints (User-Set)
- Pure React web app — **no Expo, Metro, or React Native** dependencies.
- HttpOnly cookie-based JWT auth (`cargoone_session`, Secure, SameSite=Lax);
  **no JWT in localStorage / IndexedDB / JS-accessible memory**.
- Never expose Google Maps or Stripe keys to the browser during Stage 2.
- **Do not touch** the 16 pre-existing failing backend tests (historical
  data drift in the source repo).
- No commits, no GitHub push, no Publish/Deploy, no custom-domain switch,
  no live Stripe / Google credentials until the user explicitly authorises.

## Personas
1. **Customer** — posts jobs, receives quotes/bids, pays deposits, tracks
   shipments, uploads POD acknowledgements, leaves reviews.
2. **Driver** — sees nearby jobs, submits bids, uploads verification
   documents, executes deliveries with live tracking, POD + signature.
3. **Admin** — approves drivers, moderates catalog/deposit bands, resolves
   disputes, monitors platform stats.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1 — Backend port + cookie auth  ✅ COMPLETE
- Ported FastAPI + Motor backend to `/app/backend`.
- Added HttpOnly cookie auth alongside legacy Bearer for mobile compat.
- Rotated JWT secret + admin password (values in `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`).
- `ALLOW_INITIAL_ADMIN_SEED=false` after first admin login.

### Phase 2 Stage 1 — Marketing + Public Auth  ✅ COMPLETE
- Marketing pages (Home, How It Works, Services, Business, Drivers, FAQ,
  Contact, Trust & Safety, About) ported to CRA.
- Public auth screens (Welcome, Login, Register) ported to CRA.

### Phase 2 Stage 2A-i — Customer Portal foundation + read-oriented screens  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- Portal primitives: `Button`, `Input`, `StatusPill`, `AddressAutocomplete`
  (server-side proxy fallback via `/api/geo/autocomplete`; **no browser
  Google key**), `GlobalSearchModal`.
- Customer routes wired through `RequireRole` + `CustomerLayout` + `PortalShell`
  (SideRail ≥1024px, BottomTabs <1024px):
  - `/customer` — Dashboard (search, hero, quick actions, active bookings,
    categories).
  - `/customer/bookings` — Active/Past tabs, search, empty states.
  - `/customer/messages` — Inbox two-pane layout with mark-as-read. Compose
    box present but **disabled** with clear next-stage copy.
  - `/customer/profile` — Editable name + phone via `PUT /api/auth/me`;
    payment / addresses / notifications rows disabled with next-stage copy.
- `/customer/post-job`, `/customer/booking/:id`, `/customer/job/:id` show
  a `ComingNext` placeholder — Stage 2A-ii work is deferred.
- Frontend testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_1.json`) — all flows
  pass, zero issues. HttpOnly cookie verified; no JWT in localStorage.

### Phase 2 Stage 2A-ii — Customer active workflows  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- New portal primitives: `RouteMap.jsx` (SVG-only; no browser Google Maps key),
  `ReviewModal.jsx` (rating stars + base64 photo attachments).
- New hook: `hooks/useCatalog.js` — 5-minute in-memory cache for categories,
  vehicles, capabilities; `requestRecommendation()` posts to
  `/api/catalog/recommend-vehicle`.
- `pages/portal/customer/PostJob.jsx` — 5-step wizard: category+title →
  route (AddressAutocomplete + live `/api/quote/estimate`) → cargo details
  → vehicle selection ("Not sure" calls `/api/catalog/recommend-vehicle`)
  → pricing (bidding|fixed) + live `/api/booking-fees/preview`. Submits to
  `POST /api/jobs` and navigates to `/customer/job/{id}`.
- `pages/portal/customer/JobDetail.jsx` — job info + RouteMap, bids list
  with verified-driver badge, `Accept Bid` calls `POST /api/bids/{id}/accept`
  then `POST /api/bookings { job_id }`. Fixed-price jobs show "Continue to
  Payment" once accepted.
- `pages/portal/customer/BookingDetail.jsx` — Overview / Chat / POD tabs
  (tabs hidden until `payment_status==="paid"`). Unpaid state shows town
  names only, deposit-locked notice, `Pay Booking Fee` footer button that
  calls `POST /api/bookings/{id}/deposit` and does `window.location.href =
  session.url`. Return handler polls `/api/payments/status/{session_id}`
  every 2s (max ~20s) then reloads booking. Tracking polls every 12s while
  status is en-route. Chat uses `GET/POST /api/bookings/{id}/messages`
  (backend authorises payment). POD renders photos/signature/GPS.
  Completion via `POST /api/bookings/{id}/complete`; ReviewModal posts to
  `/api/bookings/{id}/review`.
- App.js wired: `/customer/post-job`, `/customer/job/:id`,
  `/customer/booking/:id`; `ComingNext` retired for customer.
- Frontend testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_2.json`) — every
  wizard step + live API calls verified, zero issues. HttpOnly cookie
  posture preserved; zero `maps.googleapis.com` requests; no `AIzaSy` key
  in DOM.
- Backend regression re-run (`EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` +
  `TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` exported) — exact baseline preserved: **221 passed
  / 16 failed / 8 errors / 1 skipped**.

### Phase 2 Stage 2A-ii — Customer active workflows  🔴 PENDING USER APPROVAL
- Post Job wizard (catalog / vehicle / addresses / photos / suggested price).
- Quote workflow, bid acceptance.
- Stripe deposit checkout via `window.location.href` + return-status polling.
- Booking detail (status timeline, messaging, tracking, POD, reviews).

### Phase 2 Stage 2B — Driver Portal  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- New portal primitive: `SignaturePad.jsx` — HTML5 `<canvas>` port of the
  Expo SignaturePad with pointer/touch events; emits base64 PNG on lift.
- Driver routes wired through `RequireRole role="driver"` +
  `DriverLayout` + `PortalShell` (SideRail ≥1024px / BottomTabs <1024px)
  with 6 items: Home / Available / My Jobs / Earnings / Fleet / Profile.
- `pages/portal/driver/Dashboard.jsx` — status-aware header (pending /
  changes-requested / suspended), warning cards with `POST
  /api/auth/me/resubmit-verification`, earnings/fleet/upcoming/bids/rating/
  verification sections, all fed from `GET /api/driver/dashboard`.
- `pages/portal/driver/Jobs.jsx` — `GET /api/jobs/nearby?radius=N` with
  search box, sort chips (nearest/newest/highest £/shortest job), radius
  chips (10/20/40/75/250), pricing/category/capability advanced filters,
  min/max price range, reset-all, refresh.
- `pages/portal/driver/JobDetail.jsx` — pending-approval warning gate,
  bidding form (`POST /api/jobs/:id/bids`) with live `/api/booking-fees/preview`
  breakdown, or fixed-price accept (`POST /api/jobs/:id/accept`).
- `pages/portal/driver/MyJobs.jsx` — `GET /api/bookings/mine`.
- `pages/portal/driver/BookingDetail.jsx` — Overview/Chat/POD tabs (hidden
  until `payment_status="paid"`). Foreground tracking via
  `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` posting to `/api/tracking/:id`
  with a 30 m / 45 s throttle, denial/timeout error surfacing, auto-stop
  on unmount + when status leaves active range. Status flow via `POST
  /api/bookings/:id/status`. Chat via `GET/POST /api/bookings/:id/messages`.
  POD via `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">`
  (camera) + library picker + `SignaturePad` + delivery notes + best-effort
  GPS snapshot at submit → `POST /api/bookings/:id/pod`. Backend
  authorisation always respected.
- `pages/portal/driver/Earnings.jsx` — totals + pending + in-progress
  computed client-side from `/api/bookings/mine` (backend remains
  authoritative for the per-booking `driver_charge`).
- `pages/portal/driver/Fleet.jsx` — vehicle CRUD via `/api/driver/vehicles`
  with modal form (type / registration / make / model / year / payload /
  capability chips / default toggle).
- `pages/portal/driver/Documents.jsx` — `GET /api/users/me/documents`
  drives the required list; `POST /api/users/me/documents` with
  `{doc_type, base64}` for uploads, per-row status pills.
- `pages/portal/driver/Profile.jsx` — verified-driver badge, status pill,
  quick links, logout.
- `App.js` wired for all 9 driver routes + `/driver/*` catchall to
  Dashboard. `PortalStub` retained only for `/admin/*` until Stage 2C.
- Frontend testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_3.json`) — **zero
  issues**. Session restoration, RBAC (customer→/driver redirects away),
  every screen renders, all sensitive endpoints wired, zero
  `maps.googleapis.com` requests, no `AIzaSy` key in DOM.
- Backend regression re-run — exact baseline preserved: **221 passed / 16
  failed / 8 errors / 1 skipped**.

### Phase 2 Stage 2C — Admin Portal  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- Admin routes wired through `RequireRole role="admin"` + `AdminLayout` +
  `PortalShell` (SideRail ≥1024px / BottomTabs <1024px) with 10 items:
  Dashboard / Analytics / Users / Drivers / Jobs / Bookings / Catalog /
  Fee Bands / Queues / Profile.
- `pages/portal/admin/Dashboard.jsx` — dark "Admin Console" header, 6
  metric cards (customers/drivers/jobs/active jobs/revenue GBP/paid
  bookings) from `GET /api/admin/stats`, 6 action rows + integrated
  `GlobalSearchModal`.
- `pages/portal/admin/Analytics.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/analytics/overview`
  rendered as Marketplace / Revenue / Categories & Vehicles / Drivers /
  Customers / Operational KPI blocks with TopLists.
- `pages/portal/admin/Users.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/users?role=customer`,
  suspend flow via `POST /api/admin/users/:id/suspend` with reason prompt.
- `pages/portal/admin/Drivers.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/users?role=driver`,
  filter chips (pending / changes_requested / active / suspended / all),
  search, per-row "Review application" CTA.
- `pages/portal/admin/DriverDetail.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/drivers/:id`,
  profile + stats + action bar (approve/request-changes/suspend),
  document rows with preview/approve/reject via `POST
  /api/admin/documents/:doc_id/review`, missing-documents warning
  card, request-changes / suspend modals with reason ≥10 chars + doc-type
  chips.
- `pages/portal/admin/Jobs.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/jobs` with search.
- `pages/portal/admin/Bookings.jsx` — `GET /api/admin/bookings` with
  payment-status pill (beyond-Expo but source-backend-supported).
- `pages/portal/admin/Catalog.jsx` — tabbed CRUD for
  `/api/admin/catalog/categories|vehicles|capabilities` (create / edit /
  toggle-active / reorder-via-PUT-swap / delete).
- `pages/portal/admin/DepositBands.jsx` — `/api/admin/deposit-bands` CRUD
  with live `/api/deposit-bands/preview` calculator.
- `pages/portal/admin/Queues.jsx` — Contact + Newsletter operational
  queues via `/api/admin/contact-messages` and
  `/api/admin/newsletter-subscribers` (beyond-Expo but source-backend
  supported).
- `pages/portal/admin/Profile.jsx` — admin badge, logout via `POST
  /api/auth/logout` clears HttpOnly cookie.
- `App.js` wired for all 11 admin routes; `PortalStub` removed for admin.
- Frontend testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_4.json`) — **zero
  issues** across 15 test buckets. Includes: catalog capability
  CRUD (create+delete disposable row), deposit-band CRUD (create+delete
  disposable row), request-changes / suspend modals, driver-detail
  documents-missing card, RBAC checks (customer→/admin blocked, driver→
  /admin blocked, unauth→/auth/login), zero `maps.googleapis.com`
  requests, no `AIzaSy` key in DOM.
- Backend regression re-run — exact baseline preserved: **221 passed / 16
  failed / 8 errors / 1 skipped**.

### Phase 2D — Full-System Acceptance &amp; Remediation  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- Cross-role live E2E (Customer + Driver + Admin, disposable accounts)
  passed end-to-end via `testing_agent_v3_fork` (`iteration_5.json`, zero
  issues): Post Job wizard → job → admin driver approval → bid → accept
  → booking → Stripe TEST redirect → return-URL polling → admin
  visibility. RBAC, HttpOnly cookie posture, `maps.googleapis.com` zero
  request count all confirmed.
- **Source-parity gaps discovered and remediated:**
  1. `Settings` hub (`/settings`, `/settings/:slug`) — omitted during
     initial migration. Restored with parity to Expo
     `app/settings/[slug].tsx` (Terms / Privacy / Cookies / About /
     Support / Delete Account, versioning row).
  2. **Delete Account** flow — completely unreachable from UI.
     Restored via `POST /api/auth/me/delete` (pre-existing backend
     contract).
  3. **Public driver profile page** (`/driver-profile/:id`) — omitted.
     Restored using `GET /api/users/:id/profile`. Endpoint requires
     signed-in user (matches Expo source flow); unauthenticated hits
     render a sign-in CTA (`dpp-signin-cta`) with `?next=` return path.
  4. Customer/Driver/Admin Profile screens were pointing "Settings" /
     "Terms &amp; Privacy" rows at marketing pages (`/trust-safety`,
     `/about`). Re-pointed to the real Settings hub routes.
  5. Customer Job Detail bid card avatar now links to
     `/driver-profile/:driver_id` (parity with Expo).
- Both follow-up defects surfaced by the exhaustive audit (missing
  `Link` import in `JobDetail.jsx`, misleading "Profile not found" on
  unauthenticated `/driver-profile/:id`) were fixed and **verified by
  `bug_testing_agent`** with disposable seed data (`iteration_7.json`,
  verdict: **fixed**, success rate 100/100%).
- Historical 16F/8E baseline re-triaged (all A/B/C — pre-existing drift,
  test-state cascade, and stale fixture wiring; **zero D-genuine
  regressions**). Baseline preserved at each Phase 2D checkpoint.
- Backend regression at Phase 2D close: **235 passed / 16 failed /
  8 errors / 1 skipped** — +14 passes vs the historical baseline of
  221/16/8/1. Investigation: E2E data created during Phase 2D
  cross-role flow populated fixture records that unblocked
  previously-empty result assertions in some tests. F/E/S unchanged
  → **no new regressions**, small pass-count improvement is a fixture
  data effect only.

### Phase 2D — Full-System Production Acceptance  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- Live production acceptance pass against `https://cargoone.co.uk`
  executed via `testing_agent_v3_fork` — see
  `/app/test_reports/iteration_8.json` and the compiled
  **29-point Phase 2D Final Report** at
  `/app/memory/PHASE_2D_FINAL_REPORT.md`.
- Verdict: **PRODUCTION_ACCEPTANCE_PASS** — zero P0/P1/P2 defects.
- One P3-info hardening item flagged: `POST /api/auth/login` and
  `POST /api/auth/register` still return `access_token` in the JSON
  response body (`backend/server.py:506, 518`, `TokenResponse` at
  `backend/server.py:147-150`). Web frontend has **zero** consumers
  (grep confirmed). Removal is BLOCKED by retained Bearer/mobile
  compatibility contract — explicitly asserted by
  `backend/tests/test_cookie_auth.py:38` ("login must still return
  access_token (bearer compat)") and by `test_bearer_still_works` +
  20+ Bearer-driven backend tests. Owner decision required between
  header-gated omission (Option A, recommended), separate mobile
  endpoint (Option B), or Optional-typed schema (Option C). NOT
  applied in this pass per owner instruction.
- Backend baseline (**221 passed / 16 failed / 8 errors / 1 skipped**)
  honoured — NOT re-run. No canonical business logic altered.

### Phase P2-A — Custom Domain Attachment  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- `frontend/.env` `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://cargoone.co.uk`.
- `backend/.env` `CORS_ORIGINS` = strict whitelist
  `https://cargoone.co.uk,https://www.cargoone.co.uk` (no wildcard).
- Session cookie: `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite=Lax` + `Path=/`
  + host-only (no explicit Domain attribute).
- `www` → apex 308 with HSTS `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains;
  preload`.

### Phase 3 — Production Hardening  🟢 P2  (do NOT auto-start)
- **P2-B**: Google Maps production restricted keys + CSRF
  double-submit tokens for cookie auth.
- **P2-C**: Stripe LIVE keys + webhook receiver + real payment
  acceptance.
- **P3-info hardening (deferred)**: apply chosen backward-compatible
  separation of `access_token` from the web login response (Options
  A/B/C in the Phase 2D report).

## Known Historical Drift (DO NOT AUTO-FIX)
Baseline serial pytest suite from the source repo carries pre-existing
regressions (endpoints such as `/api/geo/markets`, `/api/quotes/estimate`
returning 404, deposit math drift, catalog vocabulary drift). Per user's
strict instruction these must not be "fixed" to make the suite green —
they will be resolved deliberately once the migration is complete.

## Testing Notes
- Test credentials: `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`.
- Frontend testing report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_1.json`.
- Preview URL is derived from `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.
