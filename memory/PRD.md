# Cargo One — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Import the existing Cargo One application from the `Cargoone2026/Cargo-one`
GitHub repository into an Emergent workspace and continue development as a
production-ready full-stack web app. The repository is the single source of
truth (FastAPI backend + MongoDB + Stripe + Google Maps + marketing website +
customer, driver and admin portals). Because the original frontend is an
Expo/React Native app, the frontend has to be **ported to standard React web
(CRA)** without altering the backend business logic, API contracts, catalog
data, deposit math or visual language.

## Constraints (User-Set)
- Pure React web app — **no Expo, Metro, or React Native** dependencies.
- HttpOnly cookie-based JWT auth (`cargoone_session`, Secure, SameSite=Lax);
  **no JWT in localStorage / IndexedDB / JS-accessible memory**.
- Never expose Google Maps or Stripe keys to the browser during Stage 2.
- **Do not touch** the 16 pre-existing failing backend tests (historical
  data drift in the source repo).
- No commits, no GitHub push, no Publish/Deploy, no custom-domain switch,
  no live Stripe / Google credentials until the user explicitly authorises.

## Personas
1. **Customer** — posts jobs, receives quotes/bids, pays deposits, tracks
   shipments, uploads POD acknowledgements, leaves reviews.
2. **Driver** — sees nearby jobs, submits bids, uploads verification
   documents, executes deliveries with live tracking, POD + signature.
3. **Admin** — approves drivers, moderates catalog/deposit bands, resolves
   disputes, monitors platform stats.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1 — Backend port + cookie auth  ✅ COMPLETE
- Ported FastAPI + Motor backend to `/app/backend`.
- Added HttpOnly cookie auth alongside legacy Bearer for mobile compat.
- Rotated JWT secret + admin password (values in `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`).
- `ALLOW_INITIAL_ADMIN_SEED=false` after first admin login.

### Phase 2 Stage 1 — Marketing + Public Auth  ✅ COMPLETE
- Marketing pages (Home, How It Works, Services, Business, Drivers, FAQ,
  Contact, Trust & Safety, About) ported to CRA.
- Public auth screens (Welcome, Login, Register) ported to CRA.

### Phase 2 Stage 2A-i — Customer Portal foundation + read-oriented screens  ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-21)
- Portal primitives: `Button`, `Input`, `StatusPill`, `AddressAutocomplete`
  (server-side proxy fallback via `/api/geo/autocomplete`; **no browser
  Google key**), `GlobalSearchModal`.
- Customer routes wired through `RequireRole` + `CustomerLayout` + `PortalShell`
  (SideRail ≥1024px, BottomTabs <1024px):
  - `/customer` — Dashboard (search, hero, quick actions, active bookings,
    categories).
  - `/customer/bookings` — Active/Past tabs, search, empty states.
  - `/customer/messages` — Inbox two-pane layout with mark-as-read. Compose
    box present but **disabled** with clear next-stage copy.
  - `/customer/profile` — Editable name + phone via `PUT /api/auth/me`;
    payment / addresses / notifications rows disabled with next-stage copy.
- `/customer/post-job`, `/customer/booking/:id`, `/customer/job/:id` show
  a `ComingNext` placeholder — Stage 2A-ii work is deferred.
- Frontend testing agent (`/app/test_reports/iteration_1.json`) — all flows
  pass, zero issues. HttpOnly cookie verified; no JWT in localStorage.

### Phase 2 Stage 2A-ii — Customer active workflows  🔴 PENDING USER APPROVAL
- Post Job wizard (catalog / vehicle / addresses / photos / suggested price).
- Quote workflow, bid acceptance.
- Stripe deposit checkout via `window.location.href` + return-status polling.
- Booking detail (status timeline, messaging, tracking, POD, reviews).

### Phase 2 Stage 2B — Driver Portal  🟠 P1
- Driver dashboard, foreground `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`,
  `<input type="file" capture="environment">` POD upload, canvas
  SignaturePad, earnings, fleet, profile.

### Phase 2 Stage 2C — Admin Portal  🟠 P1
- Approvals, catalog CRUD, deposit-band CRUD, user/driver management,
  disputes.

### Phase 3 — Production Hardening  🟢 P2
- Attach `cargoone.co.uk` domain; add production restricted Google Maps
  keys; switch Stripe to live keys + webhooks; add CSRF double-submit
  tokens for cookie auth.

## Known Historical Drift (DO NOT AUTO-FIX)
Baseline serial pytest suite from the source repo carries pre-existing
regressions (endpoints such as `/api/geo/markets`, `/api/quotes/estimate`
returning 404, deposit math drift, catalog vocabulary drift). Per user's
strict instruction these must not be "fixed" to make the suite green —
they will be resolved deliberately once the migration is complete.

## Testing Notes
- Test credentials: `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`.
- Frontend testing report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_1.json`.
- Preview URL is derived from `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.
